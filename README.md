## Overview

Vendure Eats is an open-source project that is used to demonstrate the capabilities and features of Vendure. It is built in a series of live streams of the Vendure founders [David](https://x.com/dlhck_) and [Michael](https://x.com/michlbrmly) on the [Vendure YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vendure_io/streams) and on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/vendure_io).

The stack of Vendure Eats:

- [Vendure](https://vendure.io)
- [Nx](https://nx.dev)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Features

This project is currently still under development and the features are being added as we go. The following features are planned for the project:

- [x] Monorepo Setup
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Restaurant listing and map view
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Restaurant detail page
- [ ] Customer registration and login (incl. social login/signup)
- [ ] Menu listing
- [ ] Cart functionality
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Checkout process
- [ ] Order history and order status page
- [ ] Admin dashboard for restaurants
- [ ] Admin dashboard for drivers (delivering the orders)

## Quickstart

We are using [Nx](https://nx.dev) to manage the monorepo. To get started, clone the repository and run the following commands:

Install dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

Start docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

In case your env variable `ADMIN_UI_DEV_MODE` is set to `true`, you need to build the admin ui first:

```bash
npx nx build-admin vendure 
```

Start the Vendure server and worker:

```bash
npx nx serve vendure 
npx nx serve-worker vendure 
```

To start the storefront, run:

```bash
npx nx dev storefront 
```

Following these steps, you should be able to access

- the Vendure Admin UI at `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- the Vendure Admin API playground at `http://localhost:3000/admin-api`
- the Vendure Shop API playground at `http://localhost:3000/shop-api`
- the storefront at `http://localhost:4200`.
